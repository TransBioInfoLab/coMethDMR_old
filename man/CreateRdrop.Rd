\title{Computes leave-one-out correlations (rDrop) for each CpG}
\usage{
CreateRdrop(data, method = c("pearson", "spearman"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe with rownames = sample IDs, column names = CpG IDs.}

\item{method}{method for computing correlation, can be "pearson" or "spearman"}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:

\itemize{
  \item{\code{CpG} : }{CpG ID}
  \item{\code{r_drop} : }{The correlation between each CpG with the sum of
  the rest of the CpGs}
}
}
\description{
Computes leave-one-out correlations (rDrop) for each CpG
}
\details{
An outlier CpG in a genomic region will typically have low correlation with the rest of
 the CpGs in a genomic region. On the other hand, in a cluster of co-methylated CpGs, we expect
 each CpG to have high correlation with the rest of the CpGs. The \code{r.drop} statistic is used
 to identify these co-methylated CpGs here.

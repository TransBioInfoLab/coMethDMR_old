Note: 
(1) When mixed model failed to converge, p-value for mixed model is set to 1. 
(2) When mixed model is singular, at least one of the estimated variance
    components for intercepts or slopes random effects is 0, because there isn't
    enough variability in data to estimate the random effects. In this case, the
    mixed model reduces to a fixed effects model. The p-values for these regions
    are still valid.

## Description
coMethDMR is an R package that identifies genomic regions associated with continuous phenotypes by optimally leverages covariations 
among CpGs within predefined genomic regions. Instead of testing all CpGs within a genomic region, coMethDMR carries out an additional 
step that selects comethylated sub-regions first without using any outcome information. Next, coMethDMR tests association between 
methylation within the sub-region and continuous phenotype using a random coefficient mixed effects model, which models both variations 
between CpG sites within the region and differential methylation simultaneously.

## Installation

The latest version can be installed by

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(devtools)
install_github("TransBioInfoLab/coMethDMR")
```
After installation, the coMethDMR package can be loaded into R using:

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(coMethDMR)
```

## Manual

The reference manual for coMethDMR can be downloaded from /docs/coMethDMR_0.0.0.9001.pdf. Two vignettes are available in the same directory: "1_Introduction_coMethDMR_10-9-2019.pdf" and "2_BiocParallel_for_coMethDMR_geneBasedPipeline.pdf"

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. There are two main steps in coMethDMR: (1) identifying comethylatyed clusters (2) testing methylation levels in those comethylated clusters against a phenotype".
In step 1 and 2, should we use beta value or M values for CoMethDMR?

Answer: In step (1), using M values and beta values produce similar results. See Supplementary Table 2 Comparison of using beta values or M-values for identifying co-methylated regions in first step of coMethDMR pipeline at optimal rdrop parameter value of the coMethDMR paper. 

In step (2), M-values should be used because it has better statistical properties. See Du et al. (2010) Comparison of Beta-value and M-value methods for quantifying methylation levels by microarray analysis.
